# VooDoo

A simple web application for task management, using the Google Tasks API

## Usage

This web application is pure client-side. All you need is a Google API key. Please do not use mine, it won't work on a domain other than my own.

You can, however, try out [this Demo](http://www.tvooo.de/voodoo/).

## Features

VooDoo uses the Google Tasks API to save and manage tasks. So far, not all features are implemented.

The following works:

* Add, rename, delete tasks
* Mark tasks as complete
* Add task lists
* Switch between task lists

What's missing:

* Rename and delete task lists
* Move tasks (inside a task list and in between different lists)
